# Capstone Overview

## **Predicting Depression Risk in College Students Using Machine Learning**

**Exploring Mental Health Among Student-Athletes and the Role of Physical Activity, Demographics, and Socioeconomic Factors**

### **Introduction**

Mental health issues like anxiety and depression have become increasing among college students. This study focuses on identifying which student groups—especially student-athletes—are at highest risk, and what factors can help predict or protect against depression. Using data from the Healthy Minds Study and PHQ-9 standards, I created a predictive model with 76% accuracy that can help universities proactively support students.

### **Purpose**

This project explored:

- Can machine learning predict students at high risk of depression using survey data?
- Are student-athletes more vulnerable to depression despite physical activity benefits?
- Which factors are most associated with high or low depression risk?

### **Methodology**

**Data Source:**  
The Healthy Minds Study, a national mental health survey given yearly since 2007 across 500 colleges in the US, including PHQ-9 scores and 26 variables such as GPA, therapy history, exercise habits, financial stress, and more.

**Steps Taken:**

- Reached out to HMS data holders
- Cleaned the dataset and removed missing/null values
- Created risk labels based on PHQ-9 scoring (10+ = high risk)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau, and Kusto Azure data explorer
- Built and compared machine learning models (logistic regression, polynomial regression, etc.)
- Identified top predictors and visualized them in a dashboard

### **Key Findings**

- **Exercise is the strongest protective factor** — students who exercise more than 5 hours/week are **77.8% less likely** to be at high risk for depression than those who exercise less than 1 hour a week.
- **Student-athletes**, despite higher activity levels, face **slightly higher depression risk**—likely due to academic and athletic pressure.
- **Women student-athletes** are especially at risk: nearly **1 in 2** are classified as high-risk.
- **Financial stress** is the most significant risk factor—students with “always stressful” finances are **3x more likely** to be at high risk.
- **Protective Factors**: exercise, GPA, knowing where to get help, and low stigma.
- **Logistic regression performed best**, with 76% prediction accuracy.

### **Recommendations**

1. **Early Intervention Programs**  
   Use predictive models like this to identify students at risk and intervene before crisis points are reached.

2. **Mental Health Support for Student-Athletes and Women**  
    Active students need and women should get more tailored services to their specific struggles.

3. **Increase Financial Counseling & Aid Services**  
   Given the strong link between financial stress and depression, financial wellness should be part of mental health strategies.

4. **Encourage Help-Seeking & Reduce Stigma**  
   Knowing where to get help and willingness to seek it are key protective factors—colleges should promote both, so campaigns on reducing stigma and increasing awareness can be key.

### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how machine learning, when paired with quality data, can help identify vulnerable student populations and guide targeted mental health interventions. Student-athletes, particularly women, and financially stressed students are at the highest risk and need proactive, tailored support.
